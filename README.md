# Dot-Net-To-Do-List
A simple To Do list program I made to practice C# and Dot Net.

Made by roughly following this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfEjDD8mWYg

Ideas for improvement:

Default Task CreationDate to current date.
Optional complex/detailed descriptions for tasks.
Add CSS, visual improvements.
Function for daily tasks?
Deletion/move tasks to archive, otherwise remove old tasks from immediate visability.
